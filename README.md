## About Me

I am Dakota and I like to make things. This includes everything from small APIs to entire small humans. Well, I at least helped make the humans. I'm a developer and devops engineer based in northern Utah. Off-line, I'm a parent, a coffee lover, and a sparkling water addict. My wife and I are mostly home-bodies, but we enjoy getting out when we have the Goldilocks weather conditions we love.
