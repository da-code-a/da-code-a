About Me
--

I am a (primarily Python) developer in northern Utah. I got my start as a high-school teacher in California, but found my love for technology to be a more fulfilling career. Now, I enjoy work where I can make neat things and help out those who need it.

Experience History
--

I started my career in software working for a SaaS company based here in Ogden. They were looking for an IT expert, but got me instead. I quickly rose to the rank of senior developer there and helped them modernize a PHP application that was in desperate need of some TLC.

After about a year and half there, I was picked up by Worthy Financial. I worked with them November of 2019 through April of 2021. There, I used Python and the Flask web framework to deploy an API on the AWS Lambda service. Their product helps regular people make smart investments with a solid return, while also providing capital for small business loans issued throughout the country.

Currently, I am working for a wonderful company in the med-tech field and helping others in a community that means very much to me.

Hobbies
--

Obviously, I love writing code. I would put more on here if only I had the time. However, that's neither here nor there and I have other interests, too. These include:

* Coffee making (pour-over is best method, and I'll fight you on that)
* Playing Animal Crossing and Zelda
* Wondering how my children have that much energy
* Making and drinking more coffee (to deal with said children without losing my mind)

Goals
--

Increase the overall amount of joy and love in the world.
